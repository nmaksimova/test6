After finished my 6-year diploma in general medicine at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Ho Chi Minh City in 2009, I decided to apply for a research assistant position in biostatistics at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit Vietnam (OUCRU-VN) to pursue my great interest in biostatistics. From 2011 to 2015, I worked on my PhD project titled ‘Prognostic Models in Dengue’ under the supervision of Dr Marcel Wolbers from the Biostatistics group, Prof Bridget Wills and Prof Cameron Simmons from the Dengue group. Currently, I am a post-doc researcher working at the Biostatistics group. My research of interests are prognostic modeling and longitudinal analysis, applying in various dengue-related projects conducted by the Dengue group at OUCRU.
