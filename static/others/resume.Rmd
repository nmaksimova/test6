### Postdoctoral Researcher, 
### Biostatistics group, Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Vietnam

I have had a longstanding interest in both adolescent mental health and clinical research. Currently, there are two main research areas that I am interested in: 

(1) improving decision-making and clinical judgement of medical doctors in limited-resources settings by developing and applying clinical prognostic models, 
(2) identifying factors encouraging development of psychological resilience in adolescents living with HIV or other chronic diseases.
